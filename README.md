# Linux-Audit-Log-Forensic-Analysis
This project showcases a forensic investigation using `aureport`  to analyze Linux audit logs. It answers a series of security incident questions, revealing how an attacker compromised a system and gained root access.
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `aureport`: For generating summary reports from audit logs
- CVE knowledge base: For vulnerability research

## 🎯 Investigation Goals
- Identify the compromised user account
- Detect the attack method and IP
- Trace privilege escalation and the tool used
- Determine the root exploit and type
- Identify the exfiltrated file
